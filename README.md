# Guide to using the `dot` mini game engine

This game engine is based heavily on [CrispGameLib](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib),
the delightful little game engine by [ABA Games (Kenta Cho)](https://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/).

## About `dot`

In most ways, `dot` is a spiritual port of CrispGameLib to MakeCode Arcade, though it differs in some significant ways. Those ways are:
* Collision detection works very differently.
* The API is more structured with namespaces.
* Leverage Arcade features (fonts, images).

Be sure to check out all the wonderful games created by Kenta Cho/ABA Games.
